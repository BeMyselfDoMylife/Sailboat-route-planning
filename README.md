# Sailboat-route-planning
It is a method of local route planning for a twi-wingsail sailboat.I called it "the effective thrust made good".
The force of wingsail can be orthogonal decomposed into the thrust and side force of sailboat.The side force is balanced by the side force of hull and keel,which seems to be useless for sailboat going forward. The effective thrust means the thrust projection along the desired heading(psi_d). I think the heading with biggest effective thrust is the best desired heading at present step.
Velocity Made Good(VMG) is another method for local route planning. It used the velocity polar curve as the guidance how to decide the heading next.
